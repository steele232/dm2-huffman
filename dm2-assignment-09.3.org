* TODO Explore Huffman Trees and Huffman Codes
  Your task is to compress a /special piece of information/ as compactly as
  possible, *give its encoding* and *calculate its compression ratio*.

  Recall that the *compression ratio* of an encoding is the percentage
  \(\frac{(f - v)}{f} \times 100\), where /f/ is the number of bits per symbol of the
  smallest *fixed*-length encoding, and /v/ is the average number of bits per
  symbol with the Huffman encoding.

  For example, if there were 9 different symbols in a message, \(f=4\) is the
  number of bits of the smallest fixed-length encoding, because 2^3 = 8 (not
  enough for 9) and 2^4 = 16 (enough and to spare). If the Huffman encoding of
  the message had \(v=3.12\), the compression ratio would be

  \(\frac{4 - 3.12}{4} \times 100\ \approx 22\%.\)

  The /special piece of information/ you are tasked to compress is a list of the
  first ten million primes. This is a list that starts

  |  2 |
  |  3 |
  |  5 |
  |  7 |
  | 11 |
  | 13 |
  | 17 |
  | 19 |
  | 23 |
  | 29 |

  and ends

  | 179424551 |
  | 179424571 |
  | 179424577 |
  | 179424601 |
  | 179424611 |
  | 179424617 |
  | 179424629 |
  | 179424667 |
  | 179424671 |
  | 179424673 |

  As ASCII text stored in a file with one prime per line, the size of this data
  file is slightly over 89 megabytes. The goal is to compress this down to just
  over 5 megabytes (5589056 bytes, to be exact). That\rsquo{}s a 94% compression ratio!

  Standard compression tools can only get about a 73% compression ratio for this
  ASCII data. A more clever approach is needed. Instead of compressing the list
  of prime numbers, compress a list of the /gaps/ between them!

  It doesn\rsquo{}t save much, just the unique (occurring only once) gap size of 1
  between 2 and 3, but in the spirit of de Polignac\rsquo{}s conjecture that every
  /even/ number appears infinitely often as a gap between consecutive primes,
  just consider the even-sized gaps. The result will be a list that starts with
  2 (the difference between 5 and 3), 2 (the difference between 7 and 5), 4 (the
  difference between 11 and 7), 2 (the difference between 13 and 11), 4 (the
  difference between 17 and 13), 2 (the difference between 19 and 17), 4 (the
  difference between 23 and 19), and 6 (the difference between 29 and 23).

  Generating this data is the first task. The algorithm for doing so is very
  straightforward:

  1. Find the gaps between consecutive odd primes.
  2. Store these gaps as a list of even numbers.

  Tabulating the results, the first ten gaps are as follows, where the last
  column is the list to keep:

  |  5 | - |  3 | = | 2 |
  |  7 | - |  5 | = | 2 |
  | 11 | - |  7 | = | 4 |
  | 13 | - | 11 | = | 2 |
  | 17 | - | 13 | = | 4 |
  | 19 | - | 17 | = | 2 |
  | 23 | - | 19 | = | 4 |
  | 29 | - | 23 | = | 6 |
  | 31 | - | 29 | = | 2 |
  | 37 | - | 31 | = | 6 |

  And the last ten:

  | 179424551 | - | 179424533 | = | 18 |
  | 179424571 | - | 179424551 | = | 20 |
  | 179424577 | - | 179424571 | = |  6 |
  | 179424601 | - | 179424577 | = | 24 |
  | 179424611 | - | 179424601 | = | 10 |
  | 179424617 | - | 179424611 | = |  6 |
  | 179424629 | - | 179424617 | = | 12 |
  | 179424667 | - | 179424629 | = | 38 |
  | 179424671 | - | 179424667 | = |  4 |
  | 179424673 | - | 179424671 | = |  2 |

  As a check, see if the generated list of gaps has length 9999998.

  The next step is to count how many times each gap size occurs, so that for the
  Huffman encoding scheme, the larger the frequency of occurrence, the smaller
  the number of bits encoding that gap size.

  As a correctness check, here are the first ten gap counts:

  | Gap |   Count |
  |-----+---------|
  |   2 |  738597 |
  |   4 |  738717 |
  |   6 | 1297540 |
  |   8 |  566151 |
  |  10 |  729808 |
  |  12 |  920661 |
  |  14 |  503524 |
  |  16 |  371677 |
  |  18 |  667734 |
  |  20 |  354267 |

  And the last ten:

  | Gap | Count |
  |-----+-------|
  | 190 |     1 |
  | 192 |     3 |
  | 194 |     1 |
  | 196 |     1 |
  | 198 |     6 |
  | 202 |     2 |
  | 204 |     3 |
  | 210 |     4 |
  | 220 |     1 |
  | 222 |     1 |

  Note two things from these partial gap counts:

  1. Small even numbers (< 100) are well represented, larger ones (< 1000) less
     so.
  2. Ten million primes aren\rsquo{}t enough to have /every/ even number represented;
     for example, 200, 206, 208, 212, 214, 216 and 218 do not appear even once.

* TODO Calculate Size of File
  Imagine evaluating the following two code blocks:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (require 'first-ten-million-primes)

  (defun create-ascii-file-of-first-ten-million-primes ()
    (with-temp-buffer
      (mapc (lambda (n) (insert (format "%d\n" n))) first-ten-million-primes)
      (write-region nil 0 "first-ten-million-primes.txt")))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (create-ascii-file-of-first-ten-million-primes)
#+END_SRC

  Strictly speaking, it is not necessary to create this file in order to
  calculate its size. How? What would its size be? (Knowing this size is useful
  for compression ratio comparison.)

* TODO Study and Extend Some Sample Code
  As you are required to build an elisp-structured Huffman tree that can
  compress the list of primes, use the following code block as a guide and a
  starting point. You are given code for creating a list of gaps between the
  first ten million primes, and for restoring a list (not a vector) of the first
  ten million primes from that list of gaps.

  This code also shows a possible implementation of a tree node as a symbol. The
  symbol\rsquo{}s value is the node\rsquo{}s value. The symbol\rsquo{}s plist (property list) is used
  for storing \ldquo{}pointers\rdquo to left and right children, and parent.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (require 'cl)

  (require 'first-ten-million-primes)

  (defun list-the-gaps ()
    "Create a list of the gaps between the first ten million primes.

    (loop with curr = 0
          with prev = 3
          with gap = 0
          for i from 2 upto (1- (length first-ten-million-primes))
          do (setq curr (elt first-ten-million-primes i)
                   gap (- curr prev)
                   prev curr)
          collect gap))

  (defun restore-primes (list-of-gaps)
    "Given the list of gaps starting at the gap between 3 and 5

                          collect (incf prime gap)))))

** Calculate Compression Ratios (and sizes)

#+RESULT:

*** bits per key with fixed encoding
   : I correctly calculated the number of bits per key with a fixed encoding. 
   There are 104 different keys in our hashtable so we need ceiling(log_{2}104)
   bits to hold them all. There will be some unused bits afterwards, but we will
   be able to represent every key in our table with a unique bitcode.

   | # bits | max # keys |
   |--------+------------|
   |      1 |          2 |
   |      2 |          4 |
   |      3 |          8 |
   |      4 |         16 |
   |      5 |         32 |
   |      6 |         64 |
   |      7 |        128 | <-- This is greater than 104 so we have our number!

   So we will need *7* bits to represent every key code in our hash table of
   spaces between prime numbers.

   For example:

   | key | bitcode |
   |-----+---------|
   |   2 | 0000001 |
   |   4 | 0000010 |
   |   6 | 0000011 |
   |   8 | 0000100 |
   |  14 | 0000101 |
   |  10 | 0000110 |
   |  12 | 0000111 |
   |  18 | 0001000 |
   |  20 | 0001001 |
   |  22 | 0001010 |
   |  34 | 0001011 |
   |  24 | 0001100 |
   |  16 | 0001101 |
   |  26 | 0001110 |
   |  28 | 0001111 |
   |  30 | 0010000 |

*** total number of bits (fixed key encoding)
   : I correctly calculated the total number of bits encoded with the fixed 
   : encoding. 
  
   So that is our encoding scheme, now how do we encode all 10 million primes?
   Well we just need to write down the spaces between the primes, so we would
   need 9,999,999 consecutive sections of 7 bits; where each 7 bit segment
   encodes the jump from the previous prime number to the next prime number. We
   only need one less than the number of numbers because the last prime number
   does not need a 7-bit jump to the 10,000,001^st prime number.

   7 x 9,999,999 = *69,999,993* bits

*** total number of bits (32-Binary encoding)
   : I correctly calculated the size of the first ten million primes encoded
   : as 32-bit integer binary data.

   Each prime number is a 32-bit integer (binary), and there are 10 million
   primes, that means there are 32 x 10 million = *320,000,000* bits used.

*** total number of bits (ASCII encoding)
   : I correctly calculated the size of the first ten million primes encoded
   : as ASCII data.
   
   Extended ASCII (which most OS use now) uses 8 bits per character, so with 10
   million primes, each with at least one character, that's already 80 million
   bits. In addition to that (in windows) there are two whitespace characters
   (CRLF) at the end of each line, so that's an additional 8 x 10,000,000 x 2 =
   160,000,000 bits!

   There we already have 240,000,000 bits, and that doesn't even take into
   account the number of characters required for each prime number. The biggest
   prime (17,9424,673) uses 9 characters (without commas) and so requires 72
   bits all to itself!

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    ;(require 'cl)

    ; floor(log_10 n) + 1 this would simplify my second loop quite a bit: sum (1+
    ; (floor (log_10 curr)))

   #+RESULT-IN-UNIX:

   #+RESULT-IN-WINDOWS:
   : 827,875,600

   Theoretically, the resulting ASCII encoding should be 827,875,592 bits, but
   vi and other editors append an extra (LF) character to the end of your file,
   so 827,875,600 bits.

   Checking in a windows system we find the resulting size of ASCII characters
   to represent these primes is 827,875,600 bits as a text file in windows,
   which is exactly what we expected!

   In a Unix style operating system the line ending would be encoded as (LF)
   only and will result in a smaller file: 747,875,600 bits.

   After discussion in class we will use the Unix encoding (with the extra LF
   from emacs file creation) *747,875,600* bits.

   Just the primes = 667,875,592 bits (with no (CR) or (LF) characters)

*** TODO Compression Ratio (fixed to huffman)
   : I correctly calculated the compression ratio from this fixed encoding.

   The compression ratio of an encoding is the percentage ((f−v)/f)⋅100, where f is

   the average number of bits per symbol with the variable-length (e.g. Huffman)
   encoding.
